What AWS service is primarily used for monitoring and troubleshooting data processing applications?,Multiple-choice,AWS CloudTrail,Amazon CloudWatch,AWS X-Ray,Amazon S3,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"What AWS service is primarily used for monitoring and troubleshooting data processing applications?  AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. While useful, it's not primarily focused on monitoring and troubleshooting applications. Amazon CloudWatch is the AWS service designed for monitoring and observability. It collects and tracks metrics, collects and monitors log files, sets alarms, and automatically reacts to changes in your AWS resources. This is the correct answer because it's specifically designed for monitoring and troubleshooting. AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. While it's helpful for troubleshooting, it's more focused on tracing and debugging rather than general monitoring. Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It's not used for monitoring or troubleshooting applications.",Data Operations and Support

(Select all that apply)  Regularly reviewing AWS CloudWatch metrics and logs can help maintain consistent data processing outcomes by allowing you to monitor your application's performance and troubleshoot issues. This is a correct practice. Implementing automated scaling policies for data processing services ensures that your services can handle the load and perform consistently. This is also correct. Using AWS X-Ray for tracing application requests can help identify issues and bottlenecks in your data processing applications, contributing to maintaining consistent outcomes. This is correct. Configuring CloudTrail for governance, compliance, and auditing of AWS resources is important for security and compliance but does not directly influence the consistency of data processing outcomes. However, it can indirectly support maintaining consistency by ensuring that changes and activities are tracked. Utilizing Amazon S3 lifecycle policies for data management helps manage your data efficiently but does not directly impact the consistency of data processing outcomes. However, it can indirectly support consistent data processing by ensuring that data is managed efficiently and cost-effectively.",Data Operations and Support

AWS Lambda Invoke is used to run Lambda functions but not specifically for submitting generic data processing jobs. Amazon S3 PutObject is used to upload files to S3 buckets, not for submitting data processing jobs. Amazon SQS SendMessage sends a message to an SQS queue, not for submitting data processing jobs directly. AWS Glue StartJobRun is used to start a new run of an existing AWS Glue job. This is the correct answer because AWS Glue is a service for preparing and loading data for analytics, and this API call is specifically for initiating data processing jobs.",Data Operations and Support
