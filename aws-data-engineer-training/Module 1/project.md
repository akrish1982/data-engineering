## Project Scenario:
A retail company wants to develop a new online platform to manage its inventory, sales, customer interactions, and analytics. The company is interested in exploring both relational and non-relational databases for different aspects of the platform, and also wants to incorporate a data warehousing solution for complex analytics and business intelligence.

## Project Tasks:
### Task 1: Requirement Analysis
Understand the data management needs of the retail company.
Identify which aspects of the platform would benefit from a relational database and which would be better served by a non-relational database.
### Task 2: Database Design
#### Relational Database (Using Amazon RDS):
Design a data model for inventory and sales transactions.
Implement the data model using a relational database service on AWS (e.g., Amazon RDS with MySQL, PostgreSQL).
#### Non-Relational Database (Using Amazon DynamoDB):
Design a data model for customer interactions and session data.
Implement the data model using a non-relational database service on AWS (e.g., Amazon DynamoDB).
### Task 3: Data Warehousing (Using Amazon Redshift)
Design and implement a data warehouse that integrates data from both the relational and non-relational databases.
Set up ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to populate the data warehouse.
### Task 4: [OPTIONAL] Data Analysis and Reporting
Develop SQL queries and use AWS analytics tools to generate insights and reports from the data warehouse.
Compare the performance, scalability, and ease of use between relational and non-relational databases based on the project experience.

## Deliverables:
- Design documents for the relational and non-relational data models.
- [OPTIONAL] SQL scripts or NoSQL schema definitions used for database implementation.
- [OPTIONAL] A working AWS environment with implemented databases and data warehouse.
- [OPTIONAL] A report on the ETL process and data analysis findings.
## Evaluation Criteria:
- Correctness and efficiency of the data models.
- [OPTIONAL] Successful implementation of databases and data warehouse in AWS.
- [OPTIONAL] Depth of analysis in comparing relational and non-relational databases.
