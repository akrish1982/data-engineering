# Remove the existing credentials
```
rm ~/.pulumi/credentials.json
```
# Login again with new backend
```
pulumi login s3://<your-new-bucket-name>

```
# After setting the new backend, try running your Pulumi command again:
   ```bash
   pulumi new aws-go
   ```

Let me help you understand stacks and fix the CIDR block error.

### Stacks in Pulumi
Stacks are isolated instances of your infrastructure. Common uses include:

1. Different environments
   - dev/staging/production
   - Example: `myapp-dev`, `myapp-staging`, `myapp-prod`

2. Different regions
   - When you need the same infrastructure in multiple regions
   - Example: `myapp-us-west-2`, `myapp-eu-west-1`

3. Different projects or components
   - Separating concerns like networking, applications, databases
   - Example: `network-stack`, `app-stack`, `db-stack`

### Managing Stacks

List your stacks:
```bash
pulumi stack ls
```

Delete a stack:
```bash
# First select the stack you want to delete
pulumi stack select <stack-name>

# Destroy the resources in the stack
pulumi destroy

# Remove the stack
pulumi stack rm <stack-name>
```
